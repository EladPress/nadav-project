<h2><u>general information</u></h2>
<h2>First of all Nimrod is the best educator and that is not up for debate</h2>
<h2> i study at  kannot school the school started operating in 1952 with 100 students</h2>
<h2> I study in the 10th grade With the educator (who does not throw missiles at us at all) Nimrod.<br> There are 28 students in my class Learn math, English, literature and more <br> we are a master class so most of us do 4-5 math and English units. I personally do 5 math and English units. <br> </h2>
<h2><u>Nimrod</u></h2>
<h2> my educator Nimrod is a 2 meters high with a beard and a big body And with the ability to turn<br> anyone from 3 dimensions to 2 in one step so don't be in his way (I didn't say it but he is an excellent educator) <br> For a reason no one knows, he disappeared for 3 days. <a href="https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5452971,00.html">if it interests you can, read des</a></h2>

<h2><u>My experience from the school</u></h2>
<h2>I really enjoyed it because there is a large amount of grass And there are also a lot of sunny areas <br> And there are also really good teachers like my computer science teacher who helped me in every<br> step of the way in this project.<br> There is also a dining room, it's not very good, but it's fun to eat in it with friends<br> So if you are also in the 10th grade, come and spend time with her in the suffering of school</h2>

<h2><u>Additional activities at school </u></h2>
<h2>If you want to do more things you can ride horses or work in the barn if you're in a boarding school, they<br> might even give you money for it</h2>
